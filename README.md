# UltraScaler
AI image upscaler software that can scale images up to 5x without losing quality. Due to vast trend for Generative AI content in market, I decided to make app that intelligently upscale my ai images in bulk, which can be sold on stock websites. Because they don't allow low res images.
Several ai image genertors like [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion), [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com), [BlueWillow](https://www.bluewillow.ai) allows upscaling, but are either slow or aren't automated.
